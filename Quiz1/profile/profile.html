                    Background:
I come from a background in Information Technology and Systems (ITS). Currently, I am still pursuing my education in ITS, which has equipped me with a strong foundation in technology and systems management. My academic journey has been focused on understanding the intricate workings of IT infrastructure, software development, and digital systems.

Interests:
One of my passionate interests lies in trading card games. These games captivate my attention with their strategic depth and the need for quick thinking. The world of trading card games is not only a form of entertainment but also a realm where I continuously hone my strategic skills, decision-making, and adaptability.

Skills:
Problem-solving is a prominent skill in my repertoire. My background in ITS, coupled with my passion for trading card games, has honed my ability to analyze complex situations, identify challenges, and devise effective solutions. Whether it's troubleshooting technical issues or strategizing in a high-stakes card game, I thrive in situations that demand creative problem-solving.

In addition to problem-solving, I have likely developed proficiency in IT-related skills during my academic journey. These may include programming, network management, database administration, and more. My analytical mindset and ability to grasp intricate technical concepts have likely contributed to my proficiency in these areas.

Overall, my background in ITS, my keen interest in trading card games, and my problem-solving skills combine to create a well-rounded individual who excels in both the digital and strategic realms. This unique blend of interests and skills provides me with a diverse perspective and the ability to approach challenges with a creative and analytical mindset.
